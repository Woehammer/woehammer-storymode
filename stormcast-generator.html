      "Border Breach: A boundary thought secure has been crossed. If this breach holds, control of the region shifts — and you’re expected to respond.",
      "Sabotage Strike: Fires burn where supplies once stood. The enemy isn’t here to beat you — they’re here to cripple you and vanish.",
      "Probing Attack: They advance cautiously, committing just enough to draw you out. Someone is learning how you fight.",
      "Sudden Landing: Boats beach to the south (or worse). You’re forced into a rapid march to intercept before the foothold becomes a beachhead.",

      "Drawn Into a Trap: The chase feels too easy. The enemy funnels you onto ground of their choosing — and turning back becomes impossible.",

      "Brutal Retaliation: Your actions provoke a disproportionate response. The enemy strikes harder and faster, mercy withdrawn.",
      "Widening Conflict: What began locally spreads outward. Allies, rivals, and opportunists are drawn in with their own agendas.",
      "Lines Are Drawn: Positions harden and every engagement carries long-term consequences. This will not end quietly.",

      "The Price of Victory: What you secured is cursed, compromised, or bait. Victory counts — but it carries consequences.",
